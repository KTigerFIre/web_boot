    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of <a href="Italian">Italian</a> origin consisting of a usually round, flat
        base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
        anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is
        known as a pizzaiolo.
    
        In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3]
        In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

        The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta
        in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have
        since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common
        fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),
        restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell
        ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in
        997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze ("twelve
        pizzas") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.[4][12]

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
        Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age.[19] Records of people adding other ingredients to
        bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers
        of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their
        battle shields[20][21] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.[22][23] An
        early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the
        Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and
        his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat
        the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.[24] The first mention of the word "pizza"
        comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve
        pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter
        Day."[25]
    
        Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.[26] Prior to
        that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when
        tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.[26] Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air
        stands and out of pizza bakeries.
    
        A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the
        Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza
        in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a
        pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly,
        this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen,[27] although later research cast doubt on this legend.[28] An
        official letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called
        the Pizzeria Brandi.[29]

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>
        In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a
        conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pie is slid into the oven on a
        long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or
        whatever the oven surface is. Prior to use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily
        slide on and off it.[33] When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce
        some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer
        to the crust, burning it.[34] Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in
        restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[35] in order to achieve even heat
        distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek
        pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the
        pizza oven.
